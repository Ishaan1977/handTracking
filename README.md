# ‚úã Hand Tracking Game (OpenCV + cvzone)  

This project implements **real-time hand tracking** and a fun **hand-controlled game** using **OpenCV**, **cvzone**, and a webcam.  
It leverages computer vision to detect your hand, measure its distance, and interact with on-screen objects without a controller!

## üéÆ Features  
- **Hand Distance Tracking**:  
  - `DisTrcking.py` estimates the distance of your hand from the webcam in **centimeters** using calibration.

  - `Game.py` spawns targets (circles) at random positions.
